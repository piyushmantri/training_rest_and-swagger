(1, 2, 2, 'Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...\r\n\r\nMy Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...\r\n\r\nBoth humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...\r\n\r\nTechnically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...\r\n\r\nComing to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...\r\n\r\nOn the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer\'s liberty and the episode of Mona\'s delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that \"chase excellence and success will follow\".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...\r\n\r\nSo to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...', 10),
(2, 8, 2, '\"Whatever the problem in life is... just say to yourself \'Aal Izz Well\'.. This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it..\" \"Chase Excellence and success will follow\".. \" Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams\".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...\r\n\r\n3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn\'t get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel \' Five Point Someone \' by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..\r\n\r\nThe movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film\'s music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani\'s screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan\'s finest film to date.. The film\'s climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...\r\n\r\nTo conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...', 10),
(3, 15, 3, 'Writing a review on a Diwali release is, I think, not recommendable. Because in India, this is the only festival, where people meet and greet with their relatives for at least 3 days. These days are having the highest number of viewers watching cinema in a theater. Therefore, I\'m sure you will going to watch this one, as it is known that Golmaal is a fun entertainer which can be seen together with an entire family.\r\n\r\nSo, Rohit Shetty and team are back after exactly 10 years (Golmaal 3 in 2007 Diwali) with 4th installment of the biggest comedy-movie franchise. This time, after doing a lot in comic genre, they are introducing ghosts and spirits in Golmaal Again. The story of an orphanage owner and his children. Entire story has been developed around that orphanage. And let me tell you one more thing, it is a revenge story! I\'m not talking about anyone\'s performance, as we all know that they can act good. I was amazed to see Prakash Raj doing dancing in the second half. And in that scene, you can not miss Johny Lever\'s talent, too. Oh man, he is the best comedian. The Bhulaa act is very known, but you will laugh out loud in the mike act. It was the best hilarious moment for me. Though, I was laughing very loudly in the film around 15 times. So, believe me, this is the comedy, a laugh-out-loud one.\r\n\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, I don\'t consider it a comedy film. As the base is completely different from other Golmaals. Despite having spiritual connections, these characters are more realistic. Also, this is the finest work of visuals by Rohit and team. Each frame of spirits or magics has been executed superbly. In addition to that, there is beautiful Ooty. You would not, even once, look anywhere apart from screen. So, I would say this is the best Rohit Shetty & Team work.\r\n\r\nI was not expecting great. But unfortunately or say fortunately, my ticket money has been recovered during the title song itself. Rohit Shetty\'s comedy films are my The Most Priority to go to city\'s best theater for the sake of watching the title song. I was tapping my foot continuously, even my teeth were dancing, too! So much of colours and beats and dancers and cars, and what not! This song describes how big this franchise is! Rohit\'s films do not have classic songs, so do this. In the beginning itself I got the suspense, but it was not for the climax, just the bomb at interval. Hehe! That was a mistake I think, as it was clearly predictable. Other than that, in the second half, I feel that humor level was lower because the story is unfolding. That is why it looks slower. Though, comedy is at its peek in the first half. And everyone was laughing, clapping and enjoying around me.\r\n\r\nFor me, this Diwali clash winner is undoubtedly Golmaal Again. I will go with my family again. For rating, I would like to give the installment number, 4. This horror-comedy genre in a well known franchise by Rohit and team have been attempt successfully. Kudos to all. Enjoy festivals with this year\'s biggest Bollywood commercial film.\r\n\r\nAt last, whether you call it a comedy (C-O-M-A, Comedy) or a ghost story (G-S-T, Ghost), I would like to term it as a Blockbuster (B-L-A-C-K-B-U-C-K, Blockbuster) entertainer!', 10),
(4, 12, 3, 'Awesome movie with awesome punches. Too much laugh. All actors were brilliant.If you are bore with your 09:00-05:00PM jobs then go and watch the movie and feel relax. I have seen this movie with my 10 friends, all friends were appreciating the movie.Housefull shows. All people were cheering for the movies. Just go and watch and in a simple word it is \"Paais Wasool\"', 9),
(5, 8, 1, 'Just pitifully, we have lots and lots Hindi speaking people in town and they have been here for a very long time, still the local Chinese don\'t really care to know their culture, let alone watch good Indian movies. Perhaps there are more viewers in Tibet, Yunnan of China.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of \"come of age\" movies and this is a wonderful one, it\'s like a fresh air enters into a stuffy room when I was watching it. Unlike the Hollywood or Euro films, the difficulties that the three young men encounter are not presented in a realistic and sometimes brutal way but highly musical and artistic way. Besides the stunning length, this is another feature of Indian movies.\r\n\r\nThe boys are from middle class families, obviously, or even higher society. They have time and money to go to Goa to spend their holiday, go to chic places to spend their past time, have nothing to worry. Just like any well-to-do Asian families, (I mean those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan....) the old man of the family would send their children to their own overseas company to receive \"wilderness training\" so that later they can take over the family business. Akash just cannot escape this and stays in Sydney.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the songs, the dances, the plot and the script are all marvellously put together. Who is able to resist pretty and young faces, right? Who wants to see the real McCoy of the true India? Movie is always a dream. Let\'s continue it\r\n\r\nBollywood is ushering itself into the world stage but it is still not a strong counterpart to Hollywood. There are many good Indian people people behind the scene of many big movies, directors, editors, script writers.... Yet, I am just wondering it would take how many years for the mainstream (like Hollywood) center to \"digest\" Indians after taking in Chinese like Jacky Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung. Through Hollywood, the Indians actors would be more widely known because it is a place to rocket people\'s name over one night.\r\n\r\nThe 1994 Miss World Aishwarya Rai caused a frenzy in Cannes in 2002. I hope some male \"Khan\" would do so somewhere in Oscar or Cannes again because they do deserve it.', 9),
(6, 2, 1, 'DCH is like a breath of fresh air. It shows how bringing youth into an industry is always a good thing. Just compare this film with Yaadein, from Bollywood veteran Subash Ghai.\r\n\r\nWhere as Yaadein is probably one of the worst things to come out of a camera, DCH is one the best. It\'s just one of those films you\'ll find hard not to like, basically because it\'s exactly how the medium of Indian films should be used.\r\n\r\nRather than just cut and paste a song into the film, the filmmakers have done very well to make each song feel wanted, visually interesting, and they never drag. The result is a near 3hr film that just flies by. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work, and some truly excellent casting. Everyone carries the film, and the 3 guys, Safi, Akshay and Aamir are too good together!\r\n\r\nHopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. Technically DCH can easily stand up against anything from the West. Editing, Directing, Cinematography, lighting, set design -- everything just works so well.\r\n\r\nSometimes Bollywood can produce some truly great films, and this is most definately one of them!! You must watch it.', 8);
